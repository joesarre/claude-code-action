## About the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` Flag

This action uses the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag with Claude Code. This flag allows Claude to modify files in your repository without asking for permission for each change. By setting `acknowledge-dangerously-skip-permissions-responsibility` to "true", you acknowledge that you understand the risks associated with this flag.

## Output

The action will modify the files in the working directory of the calling workflow and will output a summary from Claude Code to the workflow logs. The output is also available as the `result` output variable.
